        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Ashley Lambert and I am a senior in the Graphic Design program at California State University of Sacramento. I am 22 years old and grew up in Sacramento. I graduated from John F. Kennedy in 2018 and began college in the Fall of 2018. I enjoy photography and capturing interesting subjects I come across. I enjoy taking photographs in Sacramento as well as in Utah and Arizona when I go on trips. I have a particular interest in landscape photography, but enjoy having a subject for my photographs as well. I was inspired by my dad to start photography at around the age of 12. I have also had a talent for drawing since I was a kid. Both of these skills have helped me develop a good eye for photography and design. </p>
